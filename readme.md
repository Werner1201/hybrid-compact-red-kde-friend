- Fonts
    - Install fonts like normal.

            $ ./deploy.sh


## To use
- Open Konsole / Terminal and run

            $ conky -c ~/.config/conky/hybrid-compact/hybrid-compact.conf &

- Alternatively
    - Create symlink from your selected config
    - Paste it to home folder
    - Rename symlink to .conkyrc
    - In terminal run conky

            $ conky &


## Auto Start
- Inside startup folder search for hybrid-compact-startup.sh file
- Set hybrid-compact-startup.sh to be executable
- Change the home path to your home path, seems like I can't use ~ at startup script
- Add hybrid-compact-startup.sh to auto start program
- You can adjust sleep time in the script accordingly


## Customizations
- **Line sketches toggle**
    - Line sketches background can be turn on or off from conky config file:

            -- to turn on
            lua_draw_hook_pre = 'conky_main true'

            -- to turn off
            lua_draw_hook_pre = 'conky_main false'

 
- **Distro Logo**
    - In hybrid-compact.conf, you can use distro logo from OpenLogos or alternatively you can use png image file.
        - OpenLogos example:

                ${goto 250}${color2}${font Play:bold:size=16}${alignc}${execi 300 lsb_release -d | cut -c14-} ${color}${font OpenLogos:size=24}t

        - Png image example:

                ${voffset -930}${image ~/.config/conky/hybrid-compact/images/distro-1a.png -p 475,16 -s 25x25}
                ${goto 250}${color2}${font Play:bold:size=16}${alignc}${execi 300 lsb_release -d | cut -c14-} ${color}

        - **Update 09 June 2020** 
            - Distro logo is now render from Lua script instead of Conky. To change open hybrid-rings.lua or hybrid-light-rings.lua file and search for draw_logo() function, don't forget to change home_dir value. Edit the line below:

                    local imagefile = home_dir .. "/.config/conky/hybrid-compact/images/distro-1a.png"

        - **Updates**

- **Network interface** 
    - In hybrid-compact.conf, you need to change network card interface. Replace enp7s0f1 and wlp0s20f3 with yours. This is optional. If you only have a single interface you  can commented out the second network interface.

            #${if_existing /proc/net/route wlp0s20f3}\
            #${goto 250}${font Play:style=Bold:size=8}Internal IP - wlp0s20f3 ${font Play:size=8}$# {alignr}${addr wlp0s20f3}
            #${goto 250}    ${font Play:style=Bold:size=8}Download
            #${goto 250}        ${color2}${font Play:size=8}Speed ${alignr} ${downspeed # wlp0s20f3}
            #${goto 250}        ${color}Total ${alignr} ${totaldown wlp0s20f3}
            #${goto 250}    ${font Play:style=Bold:size=8}Upload
            #${goto 250}        ${color2}${font Play:size=8}Speed ${alignr} ${upspeed # wlp0s20f3}
            #${goto 250}        ${color}Total ${alignr} ${totalup wlp0s20f3}
            #${endif}\

    - To check you network interface use command:

            $ ip link show


- **NVidia GPU**
    - This theme support NVidia GPU temperature by default. If your machine doesn't have one, you can comment the code below:

            -- {
            --     name='nvidia',
            --     arg='temp',
            --     max=110,
            --     bg_colour=0xa8a8a8,
            --     bg_alpha=0.9,
            --     fg_colour=0x4285F4,
            --     fg_alpha=0.8,
            --     x=140, y=370,
            --     radius=106,
            --     thickness=4,
            --     start_angle=0,
            --     end_angle=270,
            --     text_id=9
            -- },


- **CPUs**
    - Number of CPUs thread and Core: In hybrid-compact-rings.lua, you can reduce number of CPUs and core according to you system. Search for settings_table and modified accordingly.
    It should be simple enough to understand. The outer ring on CPU represents CPU Core temperature.
    - To check you system CPUs and Cores, use command below:

            $ lscpu | egrep 'Model name|Socket|Thread|NUMA|CPU\(s\)'


- **Disk**
    - In hybrid-compact-rings.lua, you can adjust number of partition according to your system. Search for settings_table and modified accordingly. The outer ring on storage represents ram, swap and battery usage.
 

## Known Issues
~~Sometimes cpu core temperature draw on rings and display text on conky are not in sync.~~


## Disclaimer
I am not the original creator of the conkyrc file (has been tweaked for my usage).
It was downloaded way back in 2009 and I've no information of the original creator. Credit should go to him/her.

hybrid-compact-rings.lua script is a modified and refactored version of mine. Script originally copied from conky-grapes theme's rings-v2_tpl which was created by **londonali1010** (2009), updated by **La-Manoue** (2016) and **popi** (2017), **dirn**(2020).
(Most of this Readme was created by dirn)
setup_circle_text was copied and modified from circlewriting function created by **mrpeachy**.

I do not own any of the distro logos bundled with this script. Please inform me if in case any of the logo are not allowed to be share.
I will remove it as soon as possible.
